//In this game you have several face down cards, each one with different values.
//You can flip up these cards, in order, and you will choose the last one flipped up.
//The case is: you will have some cards flipped up, and you will be able to see their value, but you are not allowed to
//choose these cards as your answer, and the goals of the game is to stop flipping cards in the one with the highest
//value.
